# EclipseChat

One of major step in learning programming is learning how to use network. Many say that "HelloWorld" of networking is chat app, thats why I've made several of them. :)

Project hosts several versions of chat client/host applications:
- basic: First attempt and it took me quite a while to write that one.
- medium: Second time I've knew how it works but wanted to refactor and write it little better.
- pico: Was quick project to challenge myself to write milti chat bare-bone.
